+.SH DESCRIPTION
+\fBscomes\fR is a simple systemtap script for watching activity of one process. Syscalls count,

+syscalls are measured.
+
+.TP
+binary
+Binary file to be executed. This process will be watched.

+\fBvarnetload\fP [\fI-d delay\fP] [\fI-t time to run\fP] [\fI-u url\fP]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+\fBvarnetload\fR is a simple python script to create reproducable sustained network traffic.
+
+In order to use it effectively, you need to have an HTTP server present in your local LAN where you
+can put files. Upload a large HTML (or any other kind of file) to the HTTP server. Use the -u option
+of the script to point to that URL. Play with the delay option to vary the load put on your network.
+
+.TP
+delay
+Sets delay between individual downloads in miliseconds. Default value is 1000. But you my find values
+range from 0 to 500 more useful.
+.TP
+time to run
+Sets total run time in seconds. Default value is 60.
+.TP
+url
+Sets downloaded resource. Default is http://myhost.mydomain/index.html.
