Installation instructions
*************************

The tuned daemon is written in pure Python. Nothing requires to be built.

For installation use 'make install'. Optionally DESTDIR can be appended.
By default, the tuned modules are installed to the Python3 destination
(e.g. /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/) and shebangs in executable
Python files are modified to use Python3. If you want tuned to use Python2
instead, use 'make PYTHON=python2 install'.
