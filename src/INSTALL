Installation instructions
*************************

The tuned daemon is written in pure Python. Nothing requires to be built.

For installation use 'make install'. Optionally DESTDIR can be appended.
By default, the tuned modules are installed to the Python3 destination
(e.g. /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/) and shebangs in executable
Python files are modified to use Python3. If you want tuned to use Python2
instead, set PYTHON to the full path of Python2. Example:
    make PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2 install

tuned requires some Python packages in order to run.
Those packages are listed in 'requirements.txt'.

Use: 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' (or 'pip install -r requirements.txt' for Python2) to install them.
