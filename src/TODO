* Implement a configurable policy which determines how many (and how big)
  log buffers can a user with a given UID create using the log_capture_start
  DBus call.
* Destroy the log handler created by log_capture_start() when the caller
  disconnects from DBus.
* Use only one timer for destroying log handlers at a time. Create a new
  timer as necessary when the old timer fires.
* Handle signals in tuned-adm so that the log_capture_finish() DBus call
  is called even if we receive a signal. This may require some rewriting
  of tuned-adm.
