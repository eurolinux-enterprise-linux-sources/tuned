== Procedure

* To list all available *Tuned* profiles on your system, use:
+
[subs=+quotes,options=+nowrap]
----
$ tuned-adm list

Available profiles:
- balanced               - General non-specialized tuned profile
- desktop                - Optimize for the desktop use-case
- latency-performance    - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption
- network-latency        - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption, focused on low latency network performance
- network-throughput     - Optimize for streaming network throughput, generally only necessary on older CPUs or 40G+ networks
- powersave              - Optimize for low power consumption
- throughput-performance - Broadly applicable tuning that provides excellent performance across a variety of common server workloads
- virtual-guest          - Optimize for running inside a virtual guest
- virtual-host           - Optimize for running KVM guests
