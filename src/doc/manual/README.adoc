= About this documentation

This directory contains source files of Tuned documentation intended for system administrators.

== Building the source

The documentation is written in the *AsciiDoc* markup language. To build it, install the link:https://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] utility and use it to convert the master file:

----
$ asciidoctor doc/tuned-documentation/master.adoc
----

This generates the `master.html` file, which you can open with your web browser.

== Structure

The `master.adoc` file is the main entry point for the documentation. It _includes_ (or, imports, loads) _assembly_ files from the `assemblies/` directory, which represent user stories. These assembly files then include _modules_ located in `modules/performance/`. Modules are reusable sections of content representing a concept, a procedure, or a reference.
